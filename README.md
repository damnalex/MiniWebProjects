# MiniWebProjects

This is a little colection of the simple one-page projects I made.

Disclaimer : Those were made to try stuff out, and thus probably don't follow the rules of clean code or wathever else. Do what you want with this, but don't consider this as good craftsmanship...

(If you like questionnable content, please go read it on [the official site](https://www.questionablecontent.net), so Jeph gets the ad revenue, thanks ;-) )

 - A list of all the pokemons, with a big and a small image:
